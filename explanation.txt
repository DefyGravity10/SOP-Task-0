The very first chicken in existence would have been the result of a genetic mutation (or mutations) taking place in a zygote produced by two almost-chickens (or proto-chickens).
This means two proto-chickens mated, combining their DNA together to form the very first cell of the very first chicken.
Somewhere along the line, genetic mutations occurred in that very first cell, and those mutations copied themselves into every other body cell as the chicken embryo grew.
The red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) native to a range of south-eastern Asian countries including India, southern China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia was believed to be one of the birds which contributed with the mutations which led to the first chicken.
Eggs certainly came before chickens, but ‘chicken eggs’ did not—you can’t have one without the other. However, if I absolutely had to pick a side, based on the evolutionary evidence, I am on Team Egg.
